# Catching Up on <br> Video Games
> Lots of Time and Lots of Games

## Perfect Timing

As with a lot of people, I've had a lot of time during the global pandemic. I've tried to see the bright side of this by returning to one of my favourite hobbies: **video games**. It's a passtime I've dissapointingly left aside once university (and even high school) picked up. I used to think about it as being sort of a waste of time - it didn't contribute to my school work, physical well-being, or career prospects. After my friends experienced a similar decline in gaming, it lost its social appeal too.

But in the time of a tumultuous real world, the appeals of virtual ones couldn't be more enticing. In some ways it an escape, like playing the soothing *Animal Crossing*. In other ways, it can be a deeper dive to reflect on reality itself, like in the post-apocalyptic world of *The Last of Us*. And in a time where everybody is bored at home, it finally gives me and my friends something to do together, planning tactical raids in *Call of Duty: Warzone*.

## My Progress

Here are the games I've finished (or played a substantial amount of) since returning back to Canada for social distancing. If you couldn't tell, I have a preference for well-crafted, single player experiences. Working through this backlog of games is ultimately what keeps me looking forward to each day - I try to finish around a video game a week (regardless of its length).

1. *God of War*
2. *DOOM Eternal*
3. *Wolfenstein: The New Order*
4. *Titanfall 2*
5. *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*
6. *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* (re-play)
6. *Shadow of the Colossus*
