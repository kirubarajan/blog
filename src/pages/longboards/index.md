# On Longboards
Skateboarding has always been a big part of my life. Since I was 9 years old, I've always had a board by my side (even if I still can't tre-flip). It's great exercise, a fun hobby to meet people, and a good metaphor for living life. My best memories from the past decade has come from longboarding with my friends, and exploring the nature around us:

One of my favourite things about longboarding is the technical depth that comes with your setup. In a lot of ways that are similar to computer science and programming, your individual skateboard configuration says a lot about you. From the art design of the board to the ride science while racing down a hill, your board is always an extension of your personality.

In this post, I would love to pay homage to the sport and share some of my favourite longboarding decks, trucks, and equipment that have helped carry me through the years.

## Design Moodboard
Longboards have a lot of range in design, and I've spent many years admiring all the interesting shapes and graphics. Here are some of my particular favourite companies and longboard designs:

I'm a sucker for anything designed by Rayne (based out of Vancouver, Canada). Here's the **Rayne Darkside** (V2) made out of bamboo sandwiched between fiber-glass:

Original Skateboards might not be the most consistent (or cost effective), but they make some damn beautiful designs. I used to ride a 34-inch version of this board ~6 years ago:

The real *kicker* were the nose/tail guards that made the entire board look very steampunk.

## Current Setup
My current daily board that I use at school (riding to class, groceries, cruising etc.) is the **Landyachtz Dinghy Emboss**:

It's been a really consistent and reliable board (I have it fitted with Independent Trucks and Seismic Crybaby wheels). I fell in love with the entire atmosphere of the board in middle school after watching [this montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwaACZkB414), and it stays true to form:

I also love the clean graphic that pays homage to the [2012 Tomahawk](https://www.google.com/search?q=landyachtz+tomahawk&client=firefox-b-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwju_8WBx-XnAhXymOAKHfnkD_4Q_AUoAnoECAwQBA&biw=1792&bih=1058#imgrc=TnbkLUL10II5LM), one of the first boards that got me into the longboarding scene.

However, my main setup back in Canada is the **Loaded Truncated Tesseract**:

It's no secret that I love short wheelbases, and the [original Tesseract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI6lcXKVT3U) was a thing of beauty. This board is made of bamboo and fiberglass, and overall is a love-letter to anybody who's even remotely into skateboarding. I ride it with Cast Ronins and Cloudride wheels:

I've ridden this board going downhill at speeds of 50+ km/h, and have effortlessly carried it around the coffee shop - it can do it all.

## Moving Forward
I feel like I'm past my peak longboarding capabilities, but I'm trying hard to get my mojo back. On campus, I always find reasons to bust out the Dinghy and feel the wind in my hair. My goal for the summer is to discover all the cool hills and side-roads to longboarding down, documenting it all the way through (and finally making that edit I've always thought about).
