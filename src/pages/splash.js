              Hi, I'm Arun. ðŸ™Œ
            </h1>
	          <p>
	            I'm a (Canadian! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦) undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania studying computer science and minoring in linguistics. 
              I'm also a <a href="/research">published</a> machine learning researcher in Penn's <a href="https://penn-nlp.github.io/">NLP Group</a> and I teach Penn's official <a href="https://cis192.github.io/"> Python course</a>.
              
              <br /> <br />
              Outside of school, I'm currently a Managing Partner at a venture capital firm named <a href="https://dormroomfund.com">Dorm Room Fund</a>.
              Previously, I've worked at a couple of interesting companies, such as <a href="https://vise.com">Vise</a>, <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>, and <a href="https://bridgewater.com">Bridgewater</a>.
			   	    I also consult with a variety of organizations, ranging from Y&#8209;Combinator backed startups to R&D/defense companies.

              <br /> <br />
              Other than that, I like brewing coffee, skateboarding, and birdwatching! 
              This website is where I write about the things that I am doing or stuff I find interesting.
