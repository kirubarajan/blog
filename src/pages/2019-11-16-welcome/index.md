# Things I Don’t Know
## My 2019 Learning Goals for Computer Science

A lot of times, it can feel like writing a programming blog is an excuse to brag about the obscure computer science knowledge you have. So this entry, motivated by [Dan Abramov’s blog post], is dedicated to highlighting the gaps in my knowledge and forecasting my focus for the year.

1. **Redux**.  I usually dabble in React for building frontends but I have 0 idea what Redux is used for (something about state? isn’t that the point of React? I’m clearly not a frontend guy).
2. **Reinforcement Learning**. Ever since MIT published [this paper] on using reinforcement learning to play Super Smash Bros, I was absolutely blown away and I have decided that I will devote the rest of my life to both RL (and Smash Bros).
3. **Cython**. This is a little embarrassing since I teach the Python course at Penn, but my only interactions with Cython are through high level packages like Tensorflow. Paradigms for compiling to a lower level language make Python the most OP language in my opinion.
4. **Pygame**. I originally got into programming when I was a kid through game development and I like the idea of going full circle and working with games again. Will probably make this a homework assignment for CIS 192.
5. **Haskell**. I really like OCaml and I believe that functional programming makes you a more civilized programmer. As somebody working in web development and machine learning, it’s rare that I’ll be able to work with Haskell professionally so I’m hoping I can work with it for fun!
6. **RSA**. I wanna implement RSA in Python. I’m actually super fascinated by cryptography (even though I suck at algebra) and I loved Khan Academy’s series on the RSA algorithm. RSA is practically what makes internet security possible and I think that’s cool.
7. **Kubernetes**. Just kidding. I’ll leave that to the pros.

I also wanna start blogging more consistently (this is my equivalent of going to the gym after New Years) this year and I might integrate a feedback button to my blog to see if people actually read my posts. So, if you made it here congrats!
