# On *Electric* Longboards
> Reflecting on Building an Electric Longboard

I recently built an electric longboard, and I love riding it. Here's a picture of the board I built:

## My Setup
1. Unlimited X Loaded Cruiser (Hub Motor)
2. Orangutang Kegels (Wheels)
3. Cast Ronin (Trucks)
4. Loaded Truncated Tesseract (Deck)

## Riding
The board feels better than any Boosted Board I've ever ridden, which is not suprising considering
that I handpicked each part after accumulating the ultimate setup through the ~6 years of owning the deck.

I think that although the board is a lot of fun to ride around aimlessly, I'll start to see it's value
more when I move out of quarantine and back into a city like Philadelphia or San Francisco.
