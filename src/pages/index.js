	          <p>
	            I'm an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania studying computer science and minoring in linguistics. 
              I'm a <a href="/research">published</a> machine learning researcher in Penn's <a href="https://penn-nlp.github.io/">NLP Group</a> and I also <a href="https://cis192.github.io/">teach a course</a> in Penn's computer science department!
              
              <br /> <br />
              	Outside of school, I'm currently a Managing Partner at a venture capital firm named <a href="https://dormroomfund.com">Dorm Room Fund</a> and a Quantitative Researcher at an AI company named <a href="https://vise.com">Vise</a>.
			  	Previously I was an intern at a hedge fund named <a href="https://bridgewater.com"> Bridgewater</a>.
			   	I also do consulting and contract work with a variety of organizations, ranging from Y&#8209;Combinator backed startups to R&D/defense companies.

              <br /> <br />
              Other than that, I like brewing coffee, skateboarding, and birdwatching! 
              This website is where I write about the things that I am doing or stuff I find interesting.
