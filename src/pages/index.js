	          <p>
	            I'm an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania studying computer science, and minoring in linguistics. 
              I'm a <a href="/research">published</a> machine learning researcher in Penn's <a href="https://penn-nlp.github.io/">NLP Group</a> and I also <a href="https://cis192.github.io/">teach a course</a> in Penn's computer science department!
              
              <br /> <br />
              Outside of school, I'm a Managing Partner at a venture capital firm named <a href="https://dormroomfund.com">Dorm Room Fund</a> and an intern at a hedge fund named <a href="https://bridgewater.com"> Bridgewater</a>.
			   I also do consulting and contracting work with a variety of organizations, ranging from Y-Combinator backed startups to R&D/defense companies.

              <br /> <br />
              Other than that, I like brewing coffee, skateboarding, and going on 2 hour long walks.
              This website is where I write about the things that I am doing or stuff I find interesting.
