# On *Electric* Longboards
> Reflecting on Building an Electric Longboard

I recently built an electric longboard after many years of dreaming, and I couldn't be happier with the results. Here's a picture of the board, 
in all of its springtime glory:

## My Setup
1. Unlimited X Loaded Cruiser (Hub Motor)
2. Orangutang Kegels (Wheels)
3. Cast Ronin (Trucks)
4. Loaded Truncated Tesseract (Deck)

## Riding
The board feels better than any Boosted Board I've ever ridden, which is not suprising considering
that I handpicked each part after accumulating the ultimate setup through the ~6 years of owning the deck.

I think that although the board is a lot of fun to ride around aimlessly, I'll start to see it's value
more when I move out of quarantine and back into a city like Philadelphia or San Francisco (I made
sure to get the extended range option).

Overall I'm very excited to ride this thing around more! Although it's playing into the "tech bro" 
caricature, it's the skateboarding roots that ultimately make this setup so important to me.
