# My Undergraduate Thesis

    This post will be under construction until I graduate, and is subject to (probably a lot of) change. For any errata, feel free to reach out to me!

## About

After (almost) 4 long years at the University of Pennsylvania, I'm finally a senior approaching my final few weeks as a student. Sentiments aside, this means that I'm also wrapping up a lot of the research on machine learning and natural language processing I've done during my time at Penn. For my program, this culminates in a senior thesis (on a topic of my choosing) during my final semester.

A single semester isn't typically enough time to make a significant contribution to the field, so I'm hoping to use this thesis as an opportunity to explore new areas of machine intelligence. I'm really excited to shift some of my focus from my previous research into generative models (i.e. language models) towards knowledge representation. I'm equally excited to work with Professor [Dan Roth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Roth), who helped pioneer the field of machine reasoning. 

I'll be using this part of my website as a public workspace for my foray into **information extraction, knowledge graph construction, and machine reasoning**. This will probably include (but isn't limited to) code snippets, equations/derivations, background reading, literature review, and personal hot takes.
