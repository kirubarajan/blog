# On Vision Walks

Since the start of quarantine, I've been spending a lot more time outdoors (2 meters from others). In particular, I've been
going on walks for 2 to 3 hours each day. I jokingly refer to them with my friends as "Vision Walks", I've found it to be a great way to relieve tension, daydream, and even think
about work. I've had a lot of good ideas and even better vibes from this new-ish habit!

Here are some photos I've taken over the weeks (mostly of foliage and clouds) in beautiful
