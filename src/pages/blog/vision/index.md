# On Vision Walks
> Keeping Myself Sane and Active

Since the start of quarantine, I've been spending a lot more time outdoors (2 meters from others) by going on walks for 2 to 3 hours each day. I jokingly refer to them with my friends as **"Vision Walks"**. I've found it to be a great way to relieve tension, think creatively about work, and engage in my newly found hobby of birdwatching. Overall, it's been a huge improvement to my mental and physical health. I've had a lot of good ideas and even better lifestyle vibes from this new-ish habit!

Here are some photos I've taken over the weeks (mostly of foliage and clouds) in beautiful [Mississauga, Ontario](/blog/things):

Although I'm not a photographer, it's hard to look at sunlight seeping into a forest and *not* snap a picture. If you have any cool nature-y (preferably secluded) spots in the Toronto area, please let me know!
